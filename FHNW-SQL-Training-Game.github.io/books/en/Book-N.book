<h2>Murder at the University</h2>

 Unfortunately, the project was under a bad star already at the beginning. During the planning phase, it was not considered that an extremely large number of devices would be connected to the power supply. So, it happened again and again that the power failed for a short time.

At 5:00 p.m., while some were still working, there was another power interruption. When the lights came back on at 5:30 p.m., screams of horror echoed through the night. Professor Tim Lehmann was lying on the floor of his office in the research area, covered in blood with a screwdriver in his throat.
